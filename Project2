        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion">
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
            broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually
            dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups
            called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually
            hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.
            
            The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when
            persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout
            Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan
            Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because
            populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable
            outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and
            conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern
